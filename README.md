# Rice-crop-disease-prediction
This project is to predict disease for a rice crop.
I used CNN(convolution neural network) to train the model that perfectly predicts the disease.



-->Training set and test set are our image dataset which we feed to our neural network.


-->crop_health_assistant.ipynb is the code that trains the dataset and saves the model


-->I also deployed the trained model which is crop_health_assistant.h5 by which we can use this model to predict the disease.


-->Prediction.ipynb contains code to create GUI and to predict the disease by loading the model.




****************


Better to execute in jupyter notebook line by line to know what actually is happening.
